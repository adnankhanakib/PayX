# PayX – Crypto Escrow Prototype  

PayX is an **unfinished prototype** of a crypto escrow wallet built around a tokenized transaction concept.  
Instead of sharing wallet addresses, PayX enables senders to generate a unique token (or code) that receivers can redeem to withdraw coins into their own wallets.  

> ⚠️ **Project Status**  
> This project is **no longer actively maintained** and remains incomplete.  
> It was developed as a prototype to demonstrate the concept.
